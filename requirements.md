# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an intelligent browser automation system that automatically clicks the rerun button in Google AI Studio when generation errors occur. The system will monitor for specific error conditions and respond quickly while avoiding unnecessary clicks when no errors are present.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of Google AI Studio, I want the rerun button to be automatically clicked when generation fails, so that I don't have to manually intervene every time an error occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a red error message appears with text "Failed to generate content. Please try again." THEN the system SHALL automatically locate and click the rerun button
2. WHEN the rerun button becomes visible on hover within the bordered chat area THEN the system SHALL be able to detect and interact with it
3. WHEN the system detects the star-shaped rerun icon THEN it SHALL click it within 2 seconds of error detection
4. WHEN no error is present THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to click the rerun button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automation to be intelligent and selective, so that it only activates when actual errors occur and doesn't interfere with normal operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is monitoring the page THEN it SHALL only trigger on specific error indicators
2. WHEN generation is in progress normally THEN the system SHALL NOT interfere with the process
3. WHEN the page loads initially THEN the system SHALL wait for the interface to be fully loaded before monitoring
4. IF multiple error messages appear in sequence THEN the system SHALL handle each one appropriately without duplicate clicks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automation to work reliably across different browser sessions, so that I have consistent functionality whenever I use Google AI Studio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit Google AI Studio in any browser tab THEN the automation SHALL activate automatically
2. WHEN the page refreshes or navigates THEN the system SHALL reinitialize monitoring
3. WHEN the DOM structure changes dynamically THEN the system SHALL adapt to find the correct elements
4. IF the rerun button location changes THEN the system SHALL still be able to locate it using multiple detection methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the automation to be fast and responsive, so that errors are resolved quickly without noticeable delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is detected THEN the system SHALL respond within 1-2 seconds
2. WHEN monitoring for errors THEN the system SHALL check at appropriate intervals without impacting page performance
3. WHEN the rerun button is clicked THEN the system SHALL confirm the action was successful
4. IF the first click attempt fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 2 additional times with brief delays
